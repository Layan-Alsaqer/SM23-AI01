A robotic arm is a manipulator that mimics the movements of a human hand. This robotic arm can be controlled and programmed for human movement in nature via ROS and Rviz programs. Our robot arm resembles the various shapes of human hand, which are one of the main parts of industrial robots, are also called robotic manipulators because they resemble human hands. These types of robotic arms are programmed and connected via joints or axes to provide rotational or linear motion.
